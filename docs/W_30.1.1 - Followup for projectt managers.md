Followup for project managers
==============

Why
---

As described in [the project manager role](F_20.2.1 - Description of a project manager.md), the project manager should manage the project.

To document progress, it's important a daily follow-up is made. A follow-up is a template that asks some basic questions about the progress.


Interval
---

On active projects (at least 1 task if being worked on), we expect daily follow-ups, Monday to Friday.


How to report
---

Write @LarsHoldgaard privately on Slack.


Template
---

- How many tasks are we working on?

- What could we do to improve the project / performance?
