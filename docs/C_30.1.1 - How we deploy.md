How we deploy
================================

**What is meant by "How we deploy"**

Deployment is the [Jarboo Deployment product](C_15.1.4 - Jarboo Deployment.md). 

**Checklist and flow**

Note: If you're unfamiliar with Git *and* Jarboo Git flow, please go through [our short intro to Git](A_15.1 - Git intro.md).

**1. Make a release**:

When a range of finished tasks is on 'Develop', we decide to make a release. 

As a general rule: it is OK if there is a some few things that still needs to be polished, but it should only be few hours of work from when the release is made.

**2. Polish the release**:

We should put the release version [technically the current branch] onto a test environment.

Here we and the customer should test the release and finish up changes.

All polish updates should be made inside the current branch.

**3. Get customer accept**

When the customers accept the application, we are ready to release.

**4. Release and start release window**

The code is then released, and then the release window starts. As stated in our [Jarboo Deployment product](C_15.1.4 - Jarboo Deployment.md), that means we have to be ready for changes for some hours after.

**5. Update Jira with release numbers**
