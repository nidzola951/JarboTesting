New Freelancer: Introduction to Jarboo
================================

Whenever we get a new freelancer on a Jarboo project, we have to go through the process described in this document.

Pre-start
--------

1) Get the freelancers e-mail
2) Get the freelancers version control ID (Github or Bitbucket in 99% of cases)

Then we need to go inside Insightly and send the two introduction e-mails:

3) Create freelancer as contact in Insightly
4) Send out template "Freelancer: Introduction e-mail" from Insightly
5) Send out each relevant academy template: "Freelancer: Jarboo Academy from Insightly"

Then we need to add the person to the relevant projects:
6) Add the person to Slack in relevant channels
7) Add person to version control project
8) Add the person to Jira ([see how to here](C_20.2.1 - Setup new resource in Jira.md))

Starting out
