Jarboo Development
--------------------------

Jarboo follows the following model for the actual development:

This development model is used for everything: both projects (big and small), features, bugs and even critical errors.

Any incoming task or project will be broken up throughout the task lifecycle into smaller elements if it makes sense. [Read about task lifecycle](C_25.1.1 - Task lifecycle.md).

Ideology and general description
---

The model comes from the original V-model from test-management.

In general the idea we have [five different roles](F_20.1 Roles - Jarboo Roles.md).

Limitations of Jarboo Development
---

Jarboo Development is meant for normal feature requests, bug fixes any anything non-urgent. The customer should not expect a response time less than 48 hours (we strive to do it much faster, but we have no legal obligation to do it).

For urgent development, we refer to [Jarboo Maintenance](C_15.1.5 - Jarboo Maintenance.md).
